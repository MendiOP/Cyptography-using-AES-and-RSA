# Cyptography-using-AES-and-RSA

"PLEASE READ THE ASSIGNMENT_1.PDF CAREFULLY"

Here , I made a basic cryptography software using python. 
This software encrypts the "PLAINTEXT" using AES algorithm and the "KEY" using RSA algotrithm.
Here i implemented a basic server-client socket programming through i sent the the cipher text and key to the client.
Then i decrypted the text using AES there.
